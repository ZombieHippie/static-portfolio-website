  p This is a really simple game  that I made overnight (5 hours) to prepare for my Honors Java class. At one point or another, I've felt that I've known Java inside and out, but before doing this project, I had not experimented with applets or the Graphics class. So, I feel Iâ€™ve learned a little bit more about that, and was happily surprised that Audio implementation was really easy.
  p If I return to this project I will be reworking the collision testing code because it is not entirely thought through and does not take into account the direction the blip came from to provide a better decision as to whether it collided a horizontal wall or vertical wall.
