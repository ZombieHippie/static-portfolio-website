  <h2>Flash Platformer</h2>
  <p>This game is built with AS3 and tends to have occasional wall collision glitches. I learned a lot from building this game and found it fascinating how collisions are handled and how the world actually moves inverted of where your character moves in order to side-scroll with the game. </p>
