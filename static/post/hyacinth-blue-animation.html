  <h2>The Girl in Hyacinth Blue Trailer</h2>
  <p>Whenever I had the opportunity to do an animation or drawing instead of an essay or presentation, I took the opportunity.</p>
  <p>This animation is based off the series of events in the book<i>The Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>. In this stop motion animation, I experiment with sound effects and changing focus to create depth for my audience. </p>
